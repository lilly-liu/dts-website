							HEY BEARS!! With a new semester comes new opportunities--so get ready for...
							<br><br>
							&#x1F389; <b>FALL 2022 AUDITIONSSSSSSSSS</b> &#x1F389;
							<br><br>
							We are currently holding Fall 2022 auditions for ALL SINGERS AND BEATBOXERS. All Cal students are invited to audition -- no prior experience necessary!
							<strong>Due to miss rona, you may audition either virtually or in-person. Please read the following guidelines carefully.</strong>
							<br><br>
							Preliminary auditions can be either an <b>in-person audition during the week of 9/5-9/9,</b> which you can sign up for <a href="https://forms.gle/izpbZQRwSkt6E2wb6"><b>here</b></a> or a <b>video submission,</b> which can be submitted by <b>Wednesday, September 7, 11:59pm.</b>
							Callback auditions will be on Sunday, September 11th, starting at 10 AM.
							<br><br>

							Directions for <strong>in-person</strong> are as follows: <br><br>

							<p class="section-item-detail">
								1. Fill out this <a href="https://forms.gle/izpbZQRwSkt6E2wb6" target="_blank">Google Form</a>.<br>
								2. If you haven’t already, sign up for a <a href="https://www.wejoinin.com/sheets/hbfte" target="_blank">preliminary audition slot</a>.<br>
								3. Please prepare a short solo (a verse and chorus of any song) for your audition. The audition will be 15-20 minutes in length, and will consist of a vocal warmup, a sight singing excerpt, and your solo.
								4. Come to the basement of Morrison Hall at the time of your audition and wait by the benches next to the front desk!</p>
							<h3 class="section-title black" style="font-size:25px;letter-spacing:0px;margin-top:0px;padding-top:0px;">Drop in auditions:</h3>
							<p class="section-item-detail">
								No sign up necessary! Just come to Morrison Basement on Friday, September 9th any time between 10 AM - 7 PM and we'll audition you.</p> 

							Directions for <strong>video</strong> are as follows: <br><br>

							1. <b>A brief introduction</b>: name, year, major, and anything else you'd like to include to introduce yourself!<br><br>
							2. <b>Warmups</b>: Download the two following links and sing along to the warmups, going as high and as low as you feel comfortable singing. For the ascending warmups, use the syllable "vee" going up and "vah" going down. For descending warmups, use the syllable "yah". It is okay if you need to skip one or two sequences to find your note.<br>
							<a href="./assets/Warmup-Asc.mp3">Ascending Warmups</a><br>
							<a href="./assets/Warmup-Des.mp3">Descending Warmups</a><br>

							3. <b>Solos</b>: Please prepare <b>TWO</b> short solos (a verse + chorus for each song), <b>without accompaniment</b>, for your audition. We prefer them to be contrasting so you can show off more versatility with your voice, but feel free to choose any songs you feel confident singing.
							<br><br>

							4. <b>Vocal Percussion</b>: If you are auditioning as vocal percussion, please record yourself singing the warmups and solos like everyone else. Afterwards, please give us a sample of your VP abilities, in any way you see fit! One great way is to pick a couple of percussive sounds you like to use and sample them one at a time, and then use them together to make a beat.
							<br><br>

							Once you've finished recording your audition video, please call it <b>"FirstName-LastName-AUDITION"</b> and email it to cal.drawntoscale@gmail.com with the subject <b>"FA22 AUDITION"</b> by Wednesday, September 7, 11:59pm.<br><br>
							Lastly, fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/izpbZQRwSkt6E2wb6"><b>Google Form</b></a> and you're all set. <br><br>

                            We will reach out to you through email with results from your audition, and how to move on to the next step if you are called back!
                            <br><br>
                            Please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:cal.drawntoscale@gmail.com">shoot us an email</a> at <b>cal.drawntoscale@gmail.com</b>  with any questions or confusions about the audition process. Thanks for your interest in DtS! :)

				Frequently Asked Questions

			<div class="underline white"></div>
			<div class="owl-carousel twitter-owl">
				<div class="item">
					<p class="testimonial-detail">
						Q. How do auditions work?
					</p>
					<div class="test-name">
						A. Our audition process comprises a round of preliminary auditions with tests of vocal range, tonal memory, sight singing, and solo ability, and a second round of callbacks. Preliminary auditions last 15-20 minutes. You will be notified a few hours to a few days after your preliminary audition about whether you have made it through to callbacks. Callbacks can take up to the entire day depending upon how many auditionees are called back. However, we do make accommodations for those with time constraints.
					</div>
				</div> <!-- /.item -->
				<div class="item">
					<p class="testimonial-detail">
						Q. What do I need to do to prepare for a preliminary audition?
					</p>
					<div class="test-name">
						A. We strongly recommend that auditionees warmup prior to the preliminary audition, as we will be testing your upper and lower range, and ability to follow our warmup exercise. We expect auditionees to prepare a solo piece between 1-2 minutes long – about the length of a verse and chorus of a pop song.
					</div>
				</div> <!-- /.item -->
				<div class="item">
					<p class="testimonial-detail">
						Q. But I can’t sight read! What should I do?
					</p>
					<div class="test-name">
						A. Don't worry! We want to see how quickly you can learn music, and one of those methods is sight singing. Some people learn better by reading music, while others learn by ear. Either is fine.
					</div>
				</div> <!-- /.item -->
				<div class="item">
					<p class="testimonial-detail">
						Q. What should I sing for my audition?
					</p>
					<div class="test-name">
						A. Sing a part of a song that showcases your voice well and you enjoy singing. Also, please make sure the song is in English!
					</div>
				</div> <!-- /.item -->
				<div class="item">
					<p class="testimonial-detail">
						Q. But I’m nervous!
					</p>
					<div class="test-name">
						A. We know. We understand that the audition process can be a nerve-wracking one. We’ve been there and were probably nervous trainwrecks at our own auditions, so we understand. We’ll try to get you to relax so you can perform to the best of your abilities.
					</div>
				</div> <!-- /.item -->
				<div class="item">
					<p class="testimonial-detail">
						Q. How do callbacks work?
					</p>
					<div class="test-name">
						A. If you are given a callback, congratulations! You will be given 1-2 short pieces to learn. The purpose of this is to see how well your voice is able to blend with the current group. You will also be asked to perform your solo piece again, along with some of the exercises from the preliminary audition individually in front of all of the members of the current group.
					</div>
				</div> <!-- /.item -->
				<div class="item">
					<p class="testimonial-detail">
						Q. What are the time commitments involved?
					</p>
					<div class="test-name">
						A. Our rehearsals are Sundays and Wednesdays 6-9 pm, apart from weekly one-hour sectionals. We also have weekly Sproul performances on Friday at noon, with warmups beginning at 11 am. We also have other events during the semester as well as a concert near the end of each semester. We expect members to be able to make all rehearsals and Sproul performances, and a number of other events. Being a member of an a cappella group could be a significant time commitment, but we enjoy every moment spent together as a performance group!
					</div>
				</div> <!-- /.item -->
				<div class="item">
					<p class="testimonial-detail">
						Q. Should I audition again if I have auditioned previously?
					</p>
					<div class="test-name">
						A. Definitely! Selections at the preliminary and the callback levels are always very difficult for us due to our limited time and the number of voices per part we need changes from semester to semester. We have seen many wonderful singers who showed great promise and simply needed a little bit more experience. Some of our members have also auditioned multiple times before getting into the group, so don’t be afraid to re-audition.
